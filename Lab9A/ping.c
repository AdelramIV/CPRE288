  // Checking the source: test the MIS bit in the MIS register (is the ISR executing
  // because the input capture event happened and interrupts were enabled for that event?
  // Clearing the interrupt: set the ICR bit (so that same event doesn't trigger another interrupt)
  // The rest of the code in the ISR depends on actions needed when the event happens.
